**RStan** is the R interface to [Stan](https://mc-stan.org). It is distributed
on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rstan) as the **rstan** package and
its source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan). Before
installation, make sure you have the necessary C++ toolchain for your system by
following the instructions in the Getting Started documents below.

## Getting Started

For installation instructions and other tips on getting started with RStan see:

* [RStan Getting Started](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)

Once you have the package up and running some good places to start are: 

* The [RStan vignettes](https://mc-stan.org/rstan/articles/) show how to fit a
model, extract the contents of a stanfit object, and use external C++ code with
a Stan program.

* The majority of the [Stan Case Studies](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies.html) 
include fully worked examples using Rstan.

Several Stan users have also contributed translations of the Getting Started page:
